Feature: Managers should be able to perform CRUD functions on shifts resources

  As a manager,
  So that I can populate the semester with the required shifts and to manage the shifts should they change,
  I want to be able to add, edit and delete shifts from a particular semester

Background: previous workshifts have been added to database
  Given user "user" exists with password "userPass"

  Given the following semesters exist:
  | semester_name       | start_date      |  end_date       |
  | Spring 2017         | 10-Jan-2017     |  10-May-2017    |
  | Fall 2017           | 10-Aug-2017     |  10-Dec-2017    |

  And the following shift_details exist:
  | location      | description             |
  | Bathroom      | Freezer Clean/Organize  |
  | Kitchen       | Deep Clean              |

  And the following shift_templates exist:
  | sd_id       | day       |  hours  | floor      | details          | semester_name |
  | 1           | Sunday    |  1      | 10s        | Small fridge     | Spring 2017   |
  | 1           | Monday    |  2      |            | Walk-in Frige    | Spring 2017   |

  Then 2 shift_details should exist
  Then 2 shift_templates should exist
  And manager "Manager" exists with password "ManagerBar"
  And I am logged in as "Manager" with password "ManagerBar"

  When I follow "Spring 2017"
  And I follow "Create New Shift"
  And I fill in "Location" with "Kitchen"
  And I fill in "Description" with "Surface Clean"
  And I fill in "Details" with "After Dinner"
  And I select "Wednesday" from "Day of the week"
  And I select "1" from "Hours"
  And I select "user" from "Assigned_user"
  And I press "Save Shift"
  And I should be on the semester page for "Spring 2017"
  Then I should see "Surface Clean"
  And I should see "After Dinner"
  And I should see "Wednesday"

  And I fill in "Details" with "WEW"
  And I select "4" from "Hours"
  And I press "Save Shift"
  And I should be on the semester page for "Spring 2017"
  Then I should see "Mopping"
  And I should see "Lounge"
  And I should see "WEW"
  And I should not see "Small Fridge"
  And I should not see "Kitchen"
  And I should not see "Deep Clean"

  When I follow "Spring 2017"
  Then I should see "Bathroom"
  And I should see "Sunday"
  And I click on the first "Delete"
  Then I should not see "Lounge"
  And I should not see "Mopping"
  And I should not see "Bathroom"

Scenario: I can generate shifts

    Given I am on the semester page for "Spring 2017"
    When I press "Generate Shifts"
    And I follow "View all shifts from this semester"
    Then I should see "Freezer Clean/Organize"

Scenario: I should be able to generate shifts

  Given I am on the semesters page
  And today is "2017/01/11"
  When I follow "Spring 2017"
  And I follow "Edit Semester Details"
